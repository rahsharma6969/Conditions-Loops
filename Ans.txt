What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on whether a condition is true or false. They allow the program to make decisions and control the flow of execution.

### Syntax:

1. **if statement:**
   ```python
   if condition:
       # code block executed if condition is true
   ```

2. **if-else statement:**
   ```python
   if condition:
       # code block executed if condition is true
   else:
       # code block executed if condition is false
   ```

3. **if-elif-else statement:**
   ```python
   if condition1:
       # code block executed if condition1 is true
   elif condition2:
       # code block executed if condition2 is true
   else:
       # code block executed if no condition is true
   ```

### Example:

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
```

Output: `Adult` (since age is 18)
